# Gaussian Process

<section>
    <p align="justify">In the most simple term, one can think of Gaussian Process as being distributions over functions. It is a supervised Machine Learning technique and was developed, in the attempt, to solve regression problems. The cool thing about Gaussian Process is that we don't need a "parametric model" to fit the data. It learns using the kernel trick. For an introduction to these techniques, I would recommend the nice review by Prof Zoubin Ghahramani on <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v521/n7553/full/nature14541.html">Probabilistic Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence </a>.</p>
