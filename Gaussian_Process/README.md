# Gaussian Process
In the most simple term, one can think of Gaussian Process as being distributions over functions. It is a supervised Machine Learning technique and was developed, in the attempt, to solve regression problems. The cool thing about Gaussian Process is that we don't need a "parametric model" to fit the data. It learns using the kernel trick.
