<h1>Machine Learning Codes</h1>

<section>
	<p align="justify">This repository contains all the codes I write during my free time. My supervisor is <a href="https://cosmoaims.wordpress.com/2010/01/01/bruce-bassett/">Prof Bruce Bassett</a> and I am currently working on applying Bayesian Inference techniques to Radio Astronomy. I am currently registered at <a href="http://www.uct.ac.za/">University of Cape Town (UCT)</a>. I am actually interested in Machine Learning, but often I hear people saying, "Machine Learning is a black box!" I just hate it. All Machine Learning techniques are built upon some well-defined mathematical models. Here, in this repository, there are various topics of Machine Learning which I have learnt (after following various lectures on Youtube). The codes are basically written from scratch, that is, after deriving all the required equations.</p>
