# Logistic Regression

<section>
    <p align="justify"> In this case, I have tried to implement the IRLS (Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares) algorithm, which is a relatively simple algorithm used in logistic regression. I have tested it using a dataset which consists of the following columns: GRE, GPA and Rank. Using these three criteria, we have to see if the student will get admitted or not (1 - admitted and 0 - not admitted). The cool thing to try next is to implement a Bayesian Logistic Regression algorithm, which will include a prior over the parameters.</p>
